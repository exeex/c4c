Current Step Title: Probe Field Removal And Split Boundaries

## Just Finished

Step 4 - Probe Field Removal And Split Boundaries cleared the direct
`TypeSpec::tag` reads from `src/frontend/hir/hir_functions.cpp` in the
legacy template binding-name helper, legacy type-name helper, and
member-typedef owner metadata presence check. Template signature substitution
now keeps TextId spelling first and uses binding-map metadata only when the
binding family is unambiguous; parameter-pack expansion similarly recovers a
unique `name#N` binding family without reading rendered tag spelling.

This packet completed the local using-alias carrier fix. Parser typedef
resolution now preserves an alias target's structured typedef identity instead
of overwriting it with the local alias name when the target already carries
owner/member TextIds. Record definitions and template instantiation clones now
carry `member_typedef_text_ids` in parallel with member typedef names, and HIR
resolves qualified dependent member typedefs by owner qualifier TextId plus
member TextId, then substitutes current template bindings through
template-parameter metadata. The local
`using Alias = typename holder<T>::alias; Alias local = input;` path now lowers
without a rendered `TypeSpec::tag` semantic key.

## Suggested Next

Continue Step 4 by rerunning the controlled deletion probe and taking the next
first-failing `TypeSpec::tag` cluster after the cleared `hir_functions.cpp`
helper/member-typedef slice.

## Watchouts

- Do not replace `TypeSpec::tag` with another rendered-string semantic field.
- `hir_functions.cpp` no longer directly reads `TypeSpec::tag` in the targeted
  helper/member-typedef cluster.
- Qualified dependent member typedefs with a unique template owner/member are
  now resolved structurally from parser TextIds and current template bindings;
  keep `member_typedef_text_ids` as the member carrier and do not replace that
  with rendered owner-name lookup.
- Preserve diagnostics, dumps, mangling, ABI/link-visible text, and final
  spelling as payloads.
- The callable zero-sized-return path should keep rendered `TypeSpec::tag`
  compatibility only when no complete structured owner metadata exists.
- The ref-overload grouping path now uses `tag_text_id` before rendered fallback
  when complete owner metadata is absent; its retained rendered tag comparison
  is only the named no-complete-metadata legacy bridge.
- The member-symbol lookup path now treats complete owner/member metadata as
  authoritative; stale rendered owner symbols are not a fallback after a
  complete miss, but `HirStructDef` fields remain a structured hit source when
  the owner lookup mirror is absent.
- The generic `NK_MEMBER` inference path now delegates owner lookup to the
  layout resolver; do not reintroduce direct `struct_defs[TypeSpec::tag]`
  lookup when complete `record_def` or TextId owner metadata is present.
- The typedef-to-struct resolver now treats complete `record_def` and TextId
  owner metadata as authoritative; keep rendered `TypeSpec::tag` fallback only
  for no-complete-metadata compatibility.
- `hir_lowering_core.cpp` still has two intentional rendered `TypeSpec::tag`
  reads: generic record compatibility and local layout TypeSpec lookup. Both
  are classified no-complete-metadata compatibility bridges, not semantic
  owner keys.
- The base layout path still uses `HirStructDef::base_tags` as final spelling
  and as no-complete-metadata compatibility input; it no longer writes
  `TypeSpec::tag`.
- The former `hir_functions.cpp` lines 35-52 deletion-probe cluster is cleared
  of direct rendered tag reads.
- `hir_types.cpp` layout/member-base helpers now classify retained rendered
  lookup as no-complete-metadata compatibility. Base traversal should continue
  to prefer complete `base_tag_text_ids` owner metadata before rendered
  `base_tags`.
- `hir_lowering_core.cpp` and `hir_build.cpp` retained failures are already
  classified fallback helpers. They may be mechanical after the
  `hir_functions.cpp` helper pattern is clarified, but should stay separate
  unless the supervisor deliberately groups compatibility-helper cleanup.
- `hir_types.cpp` still contains lookup, parity, compatibility, and
  final-spelling payload surfaces outside the cleared layout/member-base helper
  family. Split those before editing so ABI/link-visible names, diagnostics,
  dumps, and base-tag storage are not accidentally collapsed into owner-key
  semantics.
- `hir/impl/expr/call.cpp` remains a later first-wave HIR cluster after the
  top-level HIR files compile.
- Step 4 is a probe, not the final field removal. Do not commit a broken
  deletion build.
- Do not create downstream follow-up ideas until a probe reaches LIR/BIR/backend
  failures after frontend/HIR compile blockers are cleared.
- Classify each failure as parser/HIR-owned, compatibility/display/final
  spelling, or downstream metadata gap instead of fixing broad clusters inside
  the probe packet.
- Do not create new follow-up ideas for parser/HIR work that still belongs in
  this runbook.
- Do not weaken tests, mark supported cases unsupported, or add named-case
  shortcuts.
- Keep downstream LIR/BIR/backend carrier gaps as separate follow-up ideas
  instead of broadening this runbook.
- Treat any `TypeSpec::tag` deletion build as temporary until Step 5.
- `hir_lowering_core.cpp` retained rendered-tag fallback reads only for
  no-complete-metadata compatibility; do not treat those as semantic authority.

## Proof

Executor proof:

`bash -lc 'cmake --build --preset default && ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure -R "^(frontend_hir_lookup_tests|cpp_hir_.*)$"' > test_after.log 2>&1`

Result: command exited 0 and `test_after.log` was preserved as the canonical
executor proof log. The build passed, and CTest passed 73 of 73 HIR tests,
including `cpp_hir_template_member_owner_decl_and_cast`,
`cpp_hir_template_member_owner_field_and_local`, and
`cpp_hir_template_member_owner_signature_local`.
