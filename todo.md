Current Step Title: Fence Type And Aggregate Layout Compatibility

# Current Packet

## Just Finished

Step 4 - Fence Type And Aggregate Layout Compatibility reviewed the
`aggregate.cpp` byval/local aggregate layout helper that passes rendered type
text into aggregate layout lookup.

The retained raw rendered-type-text path in `selected_aggregate_type_layout()`
is now fenced as a Step 4 no-id compatibility bridge. Its owner is
`aggregate.cpp` local aggregate slot declaration, leaf discovery, and byval
copy helpers; its limitation is that those paths still thread rendered type
spelling while local aggregate slot and byval copy state lack `LirTypeRef` /
`StructNameId` carriers. Metadata-bearing byval params must continue to use
the `selected_aggregate_type_ref_layout()` path and fail closed on stale or
mismatched structured text. The removal condition is local aggregate slot state
and byval copy state carrying structured type refs instead of rendered
spelling.

No test edits were needed because behavior did not change. Existing structured
layout lookup tests continue to cover structured-table authority, no-id legacy
fallback, and metadata-rich type-ref fail-closed behavior.

## Suggested Next

Continue Step 4 by reviewing the remaining local-slot aggregate layout call
sites that bypass the local scalar byte-offset wrapper, such as direct
`lookup_backend_aggregate_type_layout()` use in pointer-store address
materialization. Fence the retained no-id path or add focused fail-closed proof
if a structured carrier is already available there.

## Watchouts

- Do not start AArch64 backend implementation work.
- Do not downgrade supported tests or replace semantic fixes with expectation
  rewrites.
- Do not treat printer, assembler, linker, diagnostic, debug-focus, or
  route-local spelling as semantic identity.
- If parser, Sema, HIR, or LIR source intent blocks this work, record a
  separate open idea instead of expanding this plan.
- Step 2 intentionally did not add an upstream `TextId` field to
  `LirStringConst`; the structured carrier is created at the LIR-to-BIR
  boundary in the BIR module text table. If a later slice needs producer-owned
  text-pool ids, record that as a separate upstream carrier initiative instead
  of widening this plan.
- x86 `module/data.cpp` raw same-module global lookup is currently final
  assembler/output spelling territory. Do not convert that before the upstream
  BIR/prepared link-name carriers are fenced.
- The direct-call bridge review is complete, and the local direct pointer-store,
  call-pointer argument, and local-aggregate pointer-value alias bridges are
  now fenced.
- The `calling.cpp` declaration identity and direct-call fallback review is
  complete. Those fallbacks are no-id compatibility only; do not bypass the
  module-boundary `LinkNameId` checks or `FunctionSymbolSet` membership when
  changing them later.
- The local pointer-store value and address-tracking fences rely on
  `FunctionSymbolSet` construction failing closed for metadata-bearing
  functions or extern declarations whose `LinkNameId` spelling cannot be
  resolved; do not bypass that module-boundary check in a later pointer bridge.
- The call-pointer argument and local-aggregate pointer-value alias fences have
  the same boundary assumption: they are only for no-id imported function
  pointer operands, not a way to recover corrupted metadata-rich function
  identity.
- The `resolve_pointer_store_address()` fence has the same boundary assumption
  for pointer-store address operands: it is no-id compatibility only and must
  not become a raw-spelling recovery path for corrupted metadata-rich identity.
- The `globals.cpp` pointer-initializer/global-address fence has the same
  boundary assumption: scalar and aggregate pointer initializers with present
  function `LinkNameId` metadata must pass `FunctionSymbolSet` membership and
  must not recover through raw initializer spelling.
- The central `TypeDeclMap` layout fallback is retained only for no-id legacy
  declarations. Metadata-bearing type refs must stay on
  `lookup_backend_aggregate_type_ref_layout_result()` so stale `StructNameId`
  text and parity mismatches fail closed instead of recovering through rendered
  type spelling.
- The local GEP/addressing wrapper fence is comment-only and deliberately does
  not tighten `resolve_aggregate_*` public raw-text helpers; their signatures do
  not yet carry `LirTypeRef` metadata.
- The local-slot scalar byte-offset fence is comment-only and deliberately does
  not change dynamic local aggregate array behavior; those helpers still only
  carry rendered element type text.
- The aggregate.cpp selected-layout fence is comment-only and deliberately does
  not change local aggregate slot declaration, leaf discovery, or byval copy
  behavior; metadata-bearing byval params already use the `LirTypeRef` lookup
  path and should keep failing closed there.

## Proof

Delegated proof run:
`bash -lc 'cmake --build --preset default && ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure -R "^backend_"' > test_after.log 2>&1`

Result: passed. `test_after.log` contains the build and backend CTest output;
CTest reported 100% tests passed, 0 failed out of 109 run, with 12 disabled
backend CLI trace/focus tests not run.
