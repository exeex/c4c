# x86_64 Backend Bring-Up After BIR Cutover

Status: Active
Source Idea: ideas/open/44_x86_64_backend_bringup_after_bir_cutover.md
Source Plan: plan.md

## Current Active Item

- Step 2: recover the highest-leverage shared BIR seam for alloca-backed
  local-slot and control-flow x86 failures, starting from `00057.c`

## Next Slice

- add the narrowest regression around
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00057_c`
- teach shared lowering or validation to accept the minimum alloca-backed
  local-slot/control-flow seam needed for that case
- re-check nearby representatives
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00086_c` and
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00138_c`
- keep Family B global/initializer-heavy modules parked until the local-slot
  seam is proven

## Completed Items

- activated idea 44 into `plan.md`
- created `todo.md` linked to the same source idea
- classified the x86 backend unsupported-module bucket into three concrete
  families:
  Family A single-function alloca-backed local-slot/control-flow failures,
  Family B global-rich initializer-heavy modules, and
  Family C stale baseline entries that already pass on the current tree
- verified current-tree drift on representative cases:
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00065_c` and
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00116_c` now pass, while
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00057_c`,
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00086_c`,
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00138_c`, and
  `c_testsuite_x86_backend_src_00143_c` still fail at the x86 unsupported
  direct-LIR/direct-BIR boundary

## Blockers

- none recorded

## Notes To Resume

- baseline reference: [test_x86_64_backend_baseline_20260409T140902Z.log](/workspaces/c4c/test_x86_64_backend_baseline_20260409T140902Z.log)
- durable classification snapshot recorded in
  [ideas/open/44_x86_64_backend_bringup_after_bir_cutover.md](/workspaces/c4c/ideas/open/44_x86_64_backend_bringup_after_bir_cutover.md)
- keep `cpp_eastl_*` parse failures out of scope unless a backend-owned coupling
  is proven
- preserve idea 41's no-rescue architecture while shrinking the unsupported
  x86 surface
- first Step 2 target: `00057.c` as the smallest alloca-backed local-slot plus
  compare-and-branch seam
