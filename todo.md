Current Step Title: Repair Parser-to-Sema Metadata Handoff Gaps

## Just Finished

Step 4 tightened the Sema consteval NTTP rendered-name compatibility route in
`ConstEvalEnv::lookup_rendered_nttp_compatibility()`. The exact route examined
was `ConstEvalEnv::lookup(Node*)` after a structured or TextId metadata miss:
the compatibility helper still checked structured/TextId NTTP maps first, but
could then fall through to flat rendered `nttp_bindings` unless the miss was
classified as local-binding metadata.

The helper now rejects rendered `nttp_bindings` lookup whenever
`nttp_bindings_by_key` or `nttp_bindings_by_text` has authoritative metadata
for the carried NTTP name and misses. The legacy rendered map remains available
only when no NTTP structured/TextId carrier participates. Added focused drift
coverage proving the legacy no-metadata path still works, while mismatched
NTTP TextId and structured metadata both block stale rendered `nttp_bindings`
re-entry.

## Suggested Next

Continue Step 4 by selecting another parser/Sema metadata handoff that remains
inside parser/Sema ownership, with special attention to any remaining flat
rendered compatibility maps that sit behind structured/TextId miss results.

## Watchouts

- The source idea remains active; Step 4 progress is not source-idea closure.
- `SourceLanguage` is declaration provenance, not linkage. Keep
  `linkage_spec` authoritative for explicit `extern "C"` conflict behavior.
- Manually constructed AST tests default zero-initialized nodes to C source
  language unless they are created through `Parser::make_node`.
- Static-member lookup still depends on parser/Sema owner and member metadata.
  A generated `NK_VAR` for `Owner::member` must carry `qualifier_text_ids`,
  `unqualified_text_id`, and the correct owner namespace context when the
  parser has the owner identity; do not restore rendered owner lookup to cover
  missing carriers.
- The remaining `$expr:` re-lex branch is compatibility-only for value args
  with no `ParsedTemplateArg::expr`, no value-arg `TypeSpec::array_size_expr`,
  no `ParsedTemplateArg::nttp_text_id`, and no `captured_expr_tokens`.
- `lookup_rendered_nttp_compatibility()` is still needed for older consteval
  NTTP parameter references that have no NTTP structured/TextId binding
  carrier. Do not broaden the gate to all local/named const metadata misses
  without first promoting those references to structured NTTP metadata.
- `captured_expr_tokens` is parser-local structured metadata. Do not promote
  stale `nttp_name`/`$expr:` text back to semantic authority when the token
  carrier exists.
- `tpl_struct_origin` remains compatibility/display spelling. Do not use it to
  rediscover template primaries or decide Sema `TypeSpec` equivalence when
  `tpl_struct_origin_key` or structured arg carriers exist.
- Simple type-only pending template args now use `TemplateArgRef` structure.
  The broad direct nested template-origin path must still stay on the legacy
  display route for now: promoting `Outer<Inner<T>>`-style pending args to
  typed nested `TemplateArgRef` carriers in the direct parser branch triggers
  existing HIR `owner struct still pending` failures in
  `template_struct_advanced.cpp` and `template_struct_nested.cpp`.
- Do not reintroduce rendered qualified-text parsing, `$expr:` debug-text
  semantic authority, string/string_view semantic lookup parameters, fallback
  spelling, expectation downgrades, or named-test shortcuts.
- If a handoff requires a cross-module carrier outside parser/Sema ownership,
  record a separate metadata idea instead of expanding idea 139.

## Proof

Ran the delegated proof command:
`cmake --build --preset default && ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure -R '^(frontend_parser_lookup_authority_tests|cpp_positive_sema_.*|eastl_cpp_external_utility_frontend_basic_cpp)$' | tee test_after.log`.

Result: build completed successfully; CTest passed `886/886` matched tests.
Final proof log path: `test_after.log`.
