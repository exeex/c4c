Current Step Title: Fence Type And Aggregate Layout Compatibility

# Current Packet

## Just Finished

Step 4 - Fence Type And Aggregate Layout Compatibility reviewed and fenced the
remaining non-memory aggregate layout raw-text wrappers/callers in
`global_initializers.cpp`, `globals.cpp`, and `call_abi.cpp`.

`lookup_global_initializer_layout_result()` now has an explicit Step 4 no-id
compatibility fence for aggregate zero-fill, recursive field descent, and raw
GEP initializer offsets. The owner is global initializer lowering; the
limitation is that recursive initializer carriers still pass rendered type text
from the LIR initializer and computed layout fields rather than `LirTypeRef` /
`StructNameId` per subobject. The removal condition is aggregate initializer
recursion threading structured type identity through array, field, and GEP
initializer paths.

`lookup_global_layout_result()` now has an explicit Step 4 no-id compatibility
fence for legacy aggregate globals whose `LirGlobal` records do not carry
`llvm_type_ref` metadata. Metadata-bearing globals stay on
`lookup_structured_global_layout_result()` and fail closed on `StructNameId`,
parity, or spelling mismatch. The removal condition is aggregate `LirGlobal`
records always carrying structured type identity.

`call_abi.cpp` now explicitly fences the raw signature aggregate layout branch
and the legacy byval parameter call sites. The owner is call ABI lowering for
legacy aggregate returns and byval parameters; the limitation is normalized
rendered signature text, including byval pointee text parsed from final LIR
spelling, when no `LirTypeRef` / `StructNameId` carrier is available or the
target ABI does not yet enforce structured aggregate signature identity. The
removal condition is all call-signature aggregate ABI paths threading
structured type refs and no longer depending on raw parsed signature text.

No test expectations were changed; the slice is comment-only and
behavior-preserving.

## Suggested Next

Continue Step 4 by reviewing any remaining aggregate-layout compatibility
bridges outside the memory files and the just-fenced global/call ABI paths.
Prefer converting to structured lookup where carriers already have
`LirTypeRef` / `StructNameId`; otherwise leave an explicit no-id fence with
owner, limitation, and removal condition.

## Watchouts

- Do not start AArch64 backend implementation work.
- Do not downgrade supported tests or replace semantic fixes with expectation
  rewrites.
- Do not treat printer, assembler, linker, diagnostic, debug-focus, or
  route-local spelling as semantic identity.
- If parser, Sema, HIR, or LIR source intent blocks this work, record a
  separate open idea instead of expanding this plan.
- Step 2 intentionally did not add an upstream `TextId` field to
  `LirStringConst`; the structured carrier is created at the LIR-to-BIR
  boundary in the BIR module text table. If a later slice needs producer-owned
  text-pool ids, record that as a separate upstream carrier initiative instead
  of widening this plan.
- x86 `module/data.cpp` raw same-module global lookup is currently final
  assembler/output spelling territory. Do not convert that before the upstream
  BIR/prepared link-name carriers are fenced.
- The direct-call bridge review is complete, and the local direct pointer-store,
  call-pointer argument, and local-aggregate pointer-value alias bridges are
  now fenced.
- The `calling.cpp` declaration identity and direct-call fallback review is
  complete. Those fallbacks are no-id compatibility only; do not bypass the
  module-boundary `LinkNameId` checks or `FunctionSymbolSet` membership when
  changing them later.
- The local pointer-store value and address-tracking fences rely on
  `FunctionSymbolSet` construction failing closed for metadata-bearing
  functions or extern declarations whose `LinkNameId` spelling cannot be
  resolved; do not bypass that module-boundary check in a later pointer bridge.
- The call-pointer argument and local-aggregate pointer-value alias fences have
  the same boundary assumption: they are only for no-id imported function
  pointer operands, not a way to recover corrupted metadata-rich function
  identity.
- The `resolve_pointer_store_address()` fence has the same boundary assumption
  for pointer-store address operands: it is no-id compatibility only and must
  not become a raw-spelling recovery path for corrupted metadata-rich identity.
- The `globals.cpp` pointer-initializer/global-address fence has the same
  boundary assumption: scalar and aggregate pointer initializers with present
  function `LinkNameId` metadata must pass `FunctionSymbolSet` membership and
  must not recover through raw initializer spelling.
- The central `TypeDeclMap` layout fallback is retained only for no-id legacy
  declarations. Metadata-bearing type refs must stay on
  `lookup_backend_aggregate_type_ref_layout_result()` so stale `StructNameId`
  text and parity mismatches fail closed instead of recovering through rendered
  type spelling.
- The local GEP/addressing wrapper fence is comment-only and deliberately does
  not tighten `resolve_aggregate_*` public raw-text helpers; their signatures do
  not yet carry `LirTypeRef` metadata.
- The local-slot scalar byte-offset fence is comment-only and deliberately does
  not change dynamic local aggregate array behavior; those helpers still only
  carry rendered element type text.
- The aggregate.cpp selected-layout fence is comment-only and deliberately does
  not change local aggregate slot declaration, leaf discovery, or byval copy
  behavior; metadata-bearing byval params already use the `LirTypeRef` lookup
  path and should keep failing closed there.
- The local pointer-store materialization conversion is behavior-preserving:
  it still uses the same structured layout table when available, but the direct
  raw aggregate layout call is now behind the local scalar byte-offset wrapper
  fence.
- The provenance scalar-subobject fence is comment-only. It does not add
  structured layout authority because the current address carriers still lack
  `LirTypeRef` / `StructNameId` metadata.
- The `addressing.cpp` conversion is behavior-preserving: the direct GEP and
  pointer-value layout lookups now enter the same fenced helper used by the
  projection helpers, but the underlying public raw-text helpers are not
  tightened until their signatures carry structured type identity.
- `local_gep.cpp` needed no code change in this packet; its wrapper already
  owns the Step 4 no-id compatibility bridge and structured-layout mismatch
  guard.
- The global initializer/global layout/call ABI fences are comment-only and
  deliberately preserve current compatibility behavior. Structured global
  layout and enforced AArch64 signature aggregate layout paths still fail
  closed when `LirTypeRef` / `StructNameId` metadata is missing or mismatched.
- `tests/backend/backend_lir_to_bir_notes_test.cpp` was reviewed only through
  the delegated backend proof; no expectation changes were needed or made.

## Proof

Delegated proof run:
`bash -lc 'cmake --build --preset default && ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure -R "^backend_"' > test_after.log 2>&1`

Result: passed. `test_after.log` contains the build and backend CTest output;
CTest reported 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 109 run, with 12
disabled backend CLI trace/focus tests not run.
