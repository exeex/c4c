Current Step Title: Migrate call composition to signature refs

## Just Finished

- Step 3 direct void fixed-integer verifier slice completed: the immediate and
  SSA direct void fixed-integer call helpers now consume the module-owned
  function signature store when `callee_signature_ref` resolves, with retained
  `callee_signature` left as the compatibility fallback for unmigrated calls.
  Nearby coverage proves supported immediate and SSA direct void integer calls
  verify with the retained signature mirror removed, while existing structured
  retained-signature disagreement checks continue to reject stale mirrors.

## Suggested Next

- Continue Step 3 with another direct-call composition consumer that still reads
  retained call text or argument type mirrors, without touching 829/830 argument
  value identity.

## Watchouts

- Do not absorb 829/830 body-use or argument identity, scalar/vector/union
  migration, or generic value-carrier work.
- Do not derive semantic signatures from rendered text, `signature_text`,
  `args_str`, parsed call strings, duplicate `arg_type_refs`, or testcase
  spelling.
- Preserve accepted aggregate owner checks from 838; wrong-module aggregate
  alternatives must fail closed.
- `verify_call_callee_signature_ref` still rejects retained structured signature
  disagreement with the store; this packet only made retained text/mirror
  presence non-authoritative for the migrated verifier consumer.
- RV64 variadic return `signext`/`zeroext` is now a structured
  `signature_return_ext_attr` fact and must stay in the store path.

## Proof

- Passed delegated proof in `test_after.log`:
  `( cmake --build --preset default && ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure -R '^(frontend_lir_function_signature_type_ref|frontend_lir_call_type_ref|frontend_hir_tests)$' && ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure -R '^backend_lir_' ) > test_after.log 2>&1`
