# Active Item

- Step 2: switch one shared helper seam off `BackendModule`
- Current slice: continue the declared-direct-call migration into the next
  native consumer after aarch64, reusing the new BIR extern-arg decoding
  surface where richer direct-BIR metadata is now concrete

# Completed

- Read `plan.md` and the linked source idea
- Confirmed `todo.md` was missing and initialized execution state for this run
- Inspected `call_decode.hpp` and found existing BIR helpers for minimal direct
  call and declared direct call module parsing
- Recorded the full-suite baseline in `test_before.log`
- Fixed `parse_bir_minimal_direct_call_module(...)` so it matches a helper
  definition returning an immediate instead of a declaration-only placeholder
- Extended `parse_bir_minimal_declared_direct_call_module(...)` to preserve
  whether the caller returns the call result or a fixed immediate
- Added focused shared-util coverage for both BIR direct-call parser helpers
- Rebuilt from scratch and confirmed full-suite parity:
  `2834/2834` tests passed before and after
- Added focused x86 BIR pipeline coverage for a direct BIR helper/main
  zero-argument direct-call module
- Switched `src/backend/x86/codegen/emit.cpp` to consume
  `parse_bir_minimal_direct_call_module(...)` before the affine-return BIR
  subset so direct BIR helper/main call pairs no longer require a legacy
  `BackendModule` parser on that path
- Rebuilt `backend_bir_tests` and reran the full
  `ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure` suite successfully
- Switched `src/backend/aarch64/codegen/emit.cpp` to consume
  `parse_bir_minimal_direct_call_module(...)` before the affine-return BIR
  subset so direct BIR helper/main call pairs now avoid the legacy
  `BackendModule` route on the native aarch64 entry too
- Added focused aarch64 BIR pipeline coverage for a direct BIR helper/main
  zero-argument direct-call module
- Rebuilt `backend_bir_tests` and confirmed full-suite parity again:
  `2834/2834` tests passed in `test_after.log`
- Extended `parse_bir_minimal_declared_direct_call_module(...)` to decode
  bounded BIR extern-call arguments into concrete immediate vs pointer-style
  metadata using declaration param types plus module symbol tables
- Added shared-util coverage proving the BIR declared-direct-call parser
  preserves pointer-style string-constant operands as concrete extern-call args
- Switched the native aarch64 direct-BIR emitter to consume the new BIR
  declared-direct-call view so that declared extern-call modules no longer need
  the legacy `BackendModule` parser on that path
- Added focused aarch64 direct-BIR pipeline coverage for a declared direct-call
  module that passes a string-constant pointer to an extern declaration and
  then returns a fixed immediate
- Rebuilt the affected backend test binaries and reran the full
  `ctest --test-dir build -j --output-on-failure` suite successfully
- Confirmed full-suite parity for this slice: `2834/2834` tests passed in
  `test_after.log`

# Next

- Reuse the new BIR declared-direct-call arg view in the next native emitter or
  shared helper seam that still routes through `BackendModule`
- Decide whether the next highest-value cut is x86 declared direct-call
  emission or further `call_decode` family cleanup around the stale
  `parse_backend_minimal_declared_direct_call_module(...)` route
- Continue shrinking stale `BackendModule`-only direct-call helpers one family
  at a time now that BIR carries bounded extern-arg metadata for this slice

# Notes

- Updated the stale `call_decode.hpp` comment to reflect that BIR already owns
  part of the direct-call surface, while legacy helpers still carry richer
  typed-call / extern-arg detail
- `test_before.log` was not present in the workspace at the start of this
  iteration; the last recorded full-suite baseline in `todo.md` was
  `2834/2834`, and this slice reran the full suite successfully in
  `test_after.log`
- This slice removes one real x86 direct-call consumer from the legacy
  `BackendModule` parser family, but aarch64 and declared-direct-call seams
  still remain
- The aarch64 direct BIR entry now matches x86 for the minimal helper/main
  zero-argument direct-call family; the next live shared seam is the richer
  declared-direct-call surface
- This slice removes the native aarch64 direct-BIR declared-direct-call path
  from the legacy `BackendModule` parser family, but x86 and the remaining
  shared legacy declared-direct-call helpers still remain
