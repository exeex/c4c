# Active Todo

Status: Active
Source Idea: ideas/open/42_typed_lir_type_ref_and_bir_ownership_follow_through.md
Source Plan: plan.md

## Active Item

- Step 1: audit the typed type boundary and backend ownership seams
- Current slice: extend the typed scalar seam beyond the first straight-line
  integer lowering helpers by removing the remaining signature-parameter text
  fallback in `lower_function_params(...)` and pinning the nearby one-parameter
  `i8` BIR fixture coverage to explicit typed `LirTypeRef` construction

## Completed

- Activated `plan.md` from
  `ideas/open/42_typed_lir_type_ref_and_bir_ownership_follow_through.md`
- Reset active execution tracking for the new plan
- Audited the current typed-type boundary and backend ownership seams:
  - `src/codegen/lir/types.hpp` still stores only text plus coarse
    `LirTypeKind`
  - `src/codegen/lir/verify.cpp` only validates emptiness and `void` exclusion
    for `LirTypeRef`
  - `src/backend/lowering/lir_to_bir.cpp` still uses
    `lower_scalar_type_text(std::string_view)` at the main scalar cast/binop/cmp
    /select/return lowering sites
  - `src/backend/lowering/lir_to_bir.cpp` still parses function-signature
    parameter text in the fallback path
  - LIR-owned backend analysis remains live in `src/backend/liveness.cpp`,
    `src/backend/regalloc.cpp`, `src/backend/generation.cpp`, and
    `src/backend/stack_layout/*.cpp`
  - target-local phi cleanup is still present in
    `src/backend/aarch64/codegen/emit.cpp` and
    `src/backend/x86/codegen/emit.cpp`
- Added exact integer-width payload support to `src/codegen/lir/types.hpp`
  through typed `LirTypeRef` integer metadata plus `LirTypeRef::integer(...)`
- Taught `src/codegen/lir/verify.cpp` to reject integer typed/text drift such
  as width/text mismatches
- Switched the first straight-line scalar lowering sites in
  `src/backend/lowering/lir_to_bir.cpp` from string decoding to typed
  `LirTypeRef` inspection for cast/binop/cmp/select/ret lowering
- Added focused backend tests that cover:
  - typed integer verifier mismatch rejection
  - typed `LirTypeRef::integer(8)` lowering through the existing i8 multiply
    BIR slice
- Converted the conditional select compare/cast lowering paths in
  `src/backend/lowering/lir_to_bir.cpp` from string-based integer decoding to
  typed `LirTypeRef` inspection
- Moved the two-parameter unsigned-char select-phi fixture in
  `tests/backend/backend_bir_test_support.cpp` onto explicit typed
  `LirTypeRef::integer(...)` constructors for its cast/cmp/phi/ret type refs
- Added a focused typed `i8` select regression in
  `tests/backend/backend_bir_lowering_tests.cpp` and kept it on the verified
  BIR path with `c4c::codegen::lir::verify_module(...)`
- Captured full-suite before/after logs in `test_fail_before.log` and
  `test_fail_after.log`
- Passed the regression guard check with no new failures and no pass-count drop
  (`2841 -> 2841`)
- Replaced the remaining `lower_function_params(...)` signature-parameter
  scalar fallback from raw `i8`/`i32`/`i64` string matching to
  `LirTypeRef`-based typed lowering
- Moved the nearby one-parameter `widen_unsigned` `i8` zext BIR fixture onto
  explicit typed `LirTypeRef::integer(...)` cast construction
- Added focused typed zext lowering coverage for the one-parameter `i8`
  straight-line slice and kept it on the verified LIR path
- Re-ran `backend_bir_tests`, nearby backend route tests, and the full suite
  with the regression guard still passing (`2841 -> 2841`)

## Next

- continue migrating nearby remaining typed integer construction sites in
  backend BIR fixtures away from raw string literals where those refs feed
  lowering decisions directly
- audit whether the empty-`params` compatibility fallback in
  `lower_function_params(...)` should stay temporarily text-backed or be
  upgraded next to typed signature-param payloads
- decide whether pointer payload support is needed immediately for the next
  lowering slice or should stay deferred until the first pointer-backed BIR
  consumer is converted

## Blockers

- none recorded

## Resume Notes

- Repo lifecycle state was `no active plan`; this todo starts from activation.
- The source idea fixes migration order as:
  1. typed LIR type ownership
  2. canonical BIR phi/control-flow surface
  3. MIR-owned liveness
  4. MIR-owned regalloc and stack-layout integration
  5. delete temporary LIR-side backend shims
- Use `todo.md` as the canonical execution state even though the reusable skill
  text mentions `plan_todo.md`.
- Immediate validating targets:
  `test_lir_verify_rejects_typed_integer_text_mismatch` and
  `test_bir_lowering_accepts_typed_two_param_u8_select_ne_phi_slice` in
  `tests/backend/backend_bir_lowering_tests.cpp`.
- Full-suite before/after comparison for this slice should use
  `test_fail_before.log` and `test_fail_after.log` with the regression-guard
  checker script.
