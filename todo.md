## Just Finished

Step 2 extracted a reusable prepared scalar memory-operand selector in
`prepared_local_slot_render.cpp`. The active guard-chain and minimal local-slot
return helpers now ask one shared selector to map prepared frame-slot or
global-symbol accesses into legal x86 memory operands instead of open-coding
that lookup and sizing logic at each call site.

## Suggested Next

Stay in Step 2 and extract the next operand helper surface around named versus
immediate scalar value selection, reusing the new memory selector so current
guard and return helpers stop open-coding value-kind checks alongside operand
rendering.

## Watchouts

- Do not add new whole-function or named-testcase x86 matcher families.
- Consume prepared CFG, value-home, move-bundle, and addressing facts instead
  of re-deriving them from local emitter shape.
- Keep idea 59 focused on scalar instruction selection structure, not on
  reopening upstream ownership from ideas 58, 60, or 61.
- Prefer one coherent instruction-family migration per packet over broad
  emitter rewrites.
- The new helper only covers scalar memory operand selection. Value rendering,
  compare planning, and broader family migration are still separate Step 2 or
  Step 3 work.
- The matching `^backend_` before/after logs are not fully green: both
  `test_before.log` and `test_after.log` fail in
  `backend_codegen_route_x86_64_variadic_double_bytes_observe_semantic_bir`,
  `backend_codegen_route_x86_64_variadic_pair_second_observe_semantic_bir`,
  `backend_codegen_route_x86_64_local_direct_dynamic_member_array_store_observe_semantic_bir`,
  and `backend_codegen_route_x86_64_local_direct_dynamic_member_array_load_observe_semantic_bir`.

## Proof

Ran the delegated proof command `cmake --build --preset default && ctest
--test-dir build -j --output-on-failure -R '^backend_'` and captured the
output in `test_after.log`. The build completed successfully after the Step 2
memory-operand selector extraction, and the `^backend_` subset still matches
the current `test_before.log` baseline with these same four failing tests:
`backend_codegen_route_x86_64_variadic_double_bytes_observe_semantic_bir`,
`backend_codegen_route_x86_64_variadic_pair_second_observe_semantic_bir`,
`backend_codegen_route_x86_64_local_direct_dynamic_member_array_store_observe_semantic_bir`,
and `backend_codegen_route_x86_64_local_direct_dynamic_member_array_load_observe_semantic_bir`.
