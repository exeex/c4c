## Active Item

- Step 2: Flip the production `emit_module_native(...)` route to BIR-first
  with a bounded legacy fallback and tests first.

## In Progress

- Reassess the next Step 2 slice now that the production backend entrypoint is
  BIR-first for the currently supported tiny slice.

## Pending

- Step 3: Remove legacy backend plumbing that is no longer exercised.
- Step 4: Clean up surviving transitional `backend_ir` naming.
- Step 5: Finish backend test migration around the BIR-first path.

## Completed

- Activated the runbook from
  `ideas/open/06_bir_cutover_and_legacy_cleanup.md`.
- Step 1 cutover-surface inventory:
  `src/backend/backend.hpp` still defaults `BackendOptions.pipeline` to
  `BackendPipeline::Legacy`.
- `src/backend/backend.cpp` only consults `options.pipeline` on the LIR entry
  path where `BackendModuleInput.module == nullptr`; once callers pass a
  lowered backend module, routing no longer branches on BIR-vs-legacy.
- `src/codegen/llvm/llvm_codegen.cpp` currently builds default backend options
  and never opts into the BIR pipeline, so production codegen still enters the
  legacy route by default.
- Added backend pipeline tests that pin the LIR-entry seam as the only current
  BIR selection surface.
- Added internal backend route tests that pin the real `c4cll --codegen asm`
  entrypoint:
  supported `return_add` now defaults to BIR text on RISC-V, while unsupported
  `global_load` still falls back to legacy LLVM IR.
- Updated `src/codegen/llvm/llvm_codegen.cpp` so the production backend path
  probes `try_lower_to_bir(...)` first, selects `BackendPipeline::Bir` for
  supported slices, and otherwise retains the temporary legacy fallback path.
- Kept `--codegen compare` stable during the cutover by leaving compare-mode
  output on the legacy text path for now.
- Targeted validation passed:
  `backend_codegen_route_riscv64_return_add_defaults_to_bir`,
  `backend_codegen_route_riscv64_global_load_falls_back_to_llvm`,
  `backend_bir_tests`, `backend_runtime_return_add`, and
  `backend_runtime_global_load`.
- Full-suite regression guard passed with zero new failures:
  `test_fail_before.log` vs `test_fail_after.log`.

## Notes

- Keep execution backend-focused; do not broaden this into unrelated cleanup.
- Preserve a fallback only if current failures show it is still required.
- Use backend-only targeted validation before broader full-suite regression
  checks.
- Current blocker to an unconditional default flip: `lower_to_bir(...)` still
  only accepts narrow single-block i32 return-immediate/add-sub slices.

## Next Slice

- After the routing seam is flipped, re-evaluate whether Step 2 should continue
  by broadening `lower_to_bir(...)` coverage or by trimming any now-redundant
  temporary fallback plumbing.

## Blockers

- `lower_to_bir(...)` is still too narrow for a safe global default flip.
